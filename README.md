Microservice Incubation Program Phase2: microservices with K8S, Helm and Istio.

## Brief Introduction

In Microservice Incubation Program Phase2, we will leverage Minikube, Helm, Istio, Kiali to learn, try and discover cloud native miroservices in K8S, including some popular design patterns with the power from Istio.
Basically we have 3 labs, and each of them represents a milestone you should try to reach:

+ For Lab0, you will setup all environments you need to complete all preceding labs.
+ For Lab1, you will use Helm to deploy 2 Charts, 1 microservice set on local Minikube cluster.
+ For Lab2, you will learn and use Istio components to implement Gateway Pattern and Resilience Patterns in your microservice built in Lab1.

## Instructions

+ Start from Lab0, follow the instructions in `README.md`, and complete all required tasks inside them. There will be some optional challenge tasks in some labs, you could decide to do them or not per your personal situation.
+ We will have sync meetings every 2 workdays, to do Q&A and knowledge sharing.
+ We will have scheduled meetings provided for volunteers to share showcases for Lab1 or Lab2.
+ Please feel free to give any comments on this program anytime.
